# OpenGL Boiler plate Project

This is an OpenGL scatfold test project that uses the glfw, GLEW, configured to use make for building on Windows using the MinGW compiler.

## Pre-requisites

In order to be able to build the project on Windows, make sure that you have MinGW installed on your system and that you have the `g++` and `make` commands on your path.

## Building the source code

For building the project just run the make command:

```
make
```

Then run the generated output from Windows Power shell.

```
./main.exe
```
